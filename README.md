### Goals

For our goals, we would like to look at common player behavior related to positions, strategies, and actions on different maps and for different teams and analyze these.
Additionally, we would like to find out how the Steam Market is affected by events such as tournaments or even events outside the CS:GO ecosystem.
Finally, we would like to answer the overarching question of how tournaments and player / team performance in these tournaments affect the prices of certain items on the Steam Market.
